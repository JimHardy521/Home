# [JimHardy: Data Science](https://jimhardy-datascience.com/)

As I upskill for a career change to data science, I am using [my website](https://jimhardy-datascience.com/) to house various practice pieces of work.

I have a degree in Computer Science, and have been working as a Maths and Further Maths teacher for the past 13 years - taking the lead on A Level Maths.

After recently completing two CodeCademy Career Path courses (in both Machine Learning and in Analytics), numerous online tutorials and personal projects, I am now enjoying working through Leetcode 75 and learning how to use GitHub

Within school, I have created numerous Geogebra applets to support my Sixth Form teaching, delivered training on this software to others, and have developed a programming club for students interested in the intersection of maths and computing. I hold Specialist Leader in Education status and am a Professional Development Lead. I once led a year-long whole school project increasing the provision of personal finance education amongst our students, and have created [MrHardyMaths](http://mrhardymaths.co.uk) to help students revise for their exams.

Prior to teaching I graduated in Computer Science from Loughborough University (gaining 78% in my final year project - ‘The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence’), and completed a placement year as an IT analyst for Mars, Masterfoods.

I live in West Bridgford (Nottingham) with my wife and daughter, and enjoy long-distance running and triathlon.
