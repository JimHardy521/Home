# [JimHardy: Data Science](https://jimhardy-datascience.com/)

As I upskill for a career change to data science, I am using my website to house various practice pieces of work.

I have a degree in Computer Science, and have been working as a Maths and Further Maths teacher for the past 13 years - taking the lead on A Level Maths.

After recently completing two CodeCademy Career Path courses (in both Machine Learning and in Analytics), numerous online tutorials and personal projects, I am now enjoying working through Leetcode 75 and learning how to use GitHub
